This project will be group project. It is centered around the idea of having fun while using each of our talents. 
At any point in this project you can work on it or leave it for months if you feel uninspired.

Story
The story so far is that humans have really messed up...they are all dead in fact. The earth has warmed to levels animal and 
humans can't survive. Before this mess all started humans attempted to make robots that mimiced the functions of nature.
They created animals and humanoid robots who encorporated advanced machine learning. Eventually the evolution of the 
learning became sourand some of the robots became violent. The main charactor is one of many "somewhat peaceful" bots 
trying to escape a hostile dead world. 

programmer notes
- Python powered (hell yeah)
- We will be using the library pyarcade. This library is fairly new so the idea of distributing may be a challange/impossible.
  we may just be impressing the large python community and leaving a mark as that random group of people who made a
  better than average game with "some new library"..... hopefully they will say "holy shit that was rad".... "i didn't know 
  python progammers made cool games!"
- Why pyarcade? It's easy to understand! 
- Why python? Because it's a fucking snake duh

Ideas (no idea is ever fixed)
- shooter 2d 
- main charactor is a humanoid cyborg(something like mega-man but original?)
- all monsters including the main charactor have some visable cog turning with body movement?
- I want all ideas to be fresh. I want everyone who is working on this to only do so when they come up with something unique or
  they feel inspired.
- all ideas should follow a post global warming theme think of mad max meets jurassic park? 

Who?
- The people who work on this have unique skill(s)
- passionate or inspired people
- sometimes lazy or busy people

why?
- experience....we all have skills we want to grow and working in a large collaboration a perfect way to do it! 
- fun?
- tell your boss how cool this game is so he/she will give you a raise? 

when?
- whenever you feel inspired
- never when you feel forced

Team (join/quit/start/die at any point)
-Brett (game dev/Project bumper lane) I make sure the bowling ball of ideas don't land in the gutter. 
-Ray (game dev/game logic specialist)
-Logan(game dev/FX manager)
-Chris(animator)

Team notes
We should feel free to edit this as we see fit. Programmers make to use a branch to encorporate your edits. All huge 
changes should be voted on or at least looked into. All programming, game logic, FX, animation, and other are prone to being 
changed or altered by myself or other team members. My goal(Brett) is to ensure the smooth overall message of the game and 
ensure ideas are flowing between team members. A majority vote of the approved team members can override my opinions. 

Team Communication
- text (group text)
- team viewer
- discord, skype, phone, any voice stuff
- burnt tire as a smoke signal? 

Who is invited to the team?
A quick vote is required for any additional members to the team. They must be enthusiastic about coding, or 
have a unique skill related to the overall goal. 

End notes.
These notes will change as our goal becomes clearer. Some people may come and go but will leave their mark on this project. 
I want to see those who feel inspired to push themselves to look back on this and say "ya that was cool when WE did that". 

WE is the important word.
